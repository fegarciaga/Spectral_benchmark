# Spectral_benchmark

The idea of this repository is to reproduce the results reported on "Hund bands in spectra multiorbital systems" by Sroda et. at. In order to do that I'll use ITensor library and spectral function calculation method given in "Time and momentum-resolved tunneling spectroscopy of pump-driven non-thermal excitations in Mott insulators" by Zawadzki et. at. 

The end goal is to use those spectral functions in order to simulate out-of-equilibrium simulations based on exact diagonalization for such model in the context of THz EM radiation of strongly correlated materials, such as NiO. This project is part of the research I've been doing on MRSEC
